# Whole-Exome-Analysis-
The human genome consists of approximately 3 billion base pairs, but only ~1-2% of this DNA codes for proteins. This coding region is known as the Exome.  Whole Exome Sequencing is a targeted sequencing strategy that focuses exclusively on these protein-coding regions.


1. The Genome vs. The Exome

    The Genome: The entire human DNA sequence (approx. 3 billion base pairs). It contains everything: genes, regulatory sequences, and a vast amount of non-coding DNA (often called "junk DNA," though it does have functions).

    The Exome: The specific part of the genome formed by Exons (the coding regions). These are the parts of the DNA that actually get translated into proteins.

The exome makes up only about 1% to 2% of the whole genome.

Why do we need it? (The Advantages) If we can sequence the whole genome (WGS), why bother with just the exome?**


**Clinical Relevance**: About 85% of known disease-causing mutations occur in the exome. If you are looking for a genetic cause of a disease (like cancer or a hereditary disorder), the answer is almost certainly in the exome.

**Cost Efficiency**: Sequencing 1% of the genome is significantly cheaper than sequencing 100% of it.

**Higher Depth (Accuracy):** Because you are sequencing a smaller target, you can sequence it "deeper" (more times) for the same cost.

Example: For $500, you might get 30× coverage on a Whole Genome, or 100× coverage on an Exome. Higher coverage means you can be much more confident that a mutation you found is real and not a machine error.

**Data Management**: WGS files are massive (hundreds of Gigabytes). WES files are smaller and easier to store and analyze on standard computers.
